## Learn how to set up issue forms

Learn how you can set up GitHub issue forms in the GitHub docs: [Syntax for GitHub's form schema](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema).

**Important**: GitHub issue forms are in beta and are only supported in public repositories.
